# Unicorny Gmail

Unicorny Gmail, forked from the example CSS Chrome Extention from lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost.

This Chrome Extension packages the CSS outlined in my blog post [How I Fixed Gmailâ€™s UX and Saved My Sanity](https://medium.com/@airshipcms/gmail-ux-sucks-so-i-fixed-it-for-my-own-sanity-b6f33898ebe3).

If you want just the raw CSS, it is also posted in [Gist](https://gist.github.com/kellishouts/e733874f7510934c4def87adf221016d).

This is my first Chrome Extension. I followed [this](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) blog post and forked off of [this](https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost) repository. :)
